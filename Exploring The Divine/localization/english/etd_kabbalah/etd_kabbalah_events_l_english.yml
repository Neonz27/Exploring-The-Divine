 etd_kabbalah_events.1.desc:0 "As you spend countless hours poring over the hundreds of ancient texts sitting in your library, you begin piecing together concepts that you previously had no understanding of. You can not deny that the discoveries astonish you to the core, however, you are beginning to realize the maieutic nature of Kabbalah. That is, for every question that you find an answer to, several more arise. You are unable to make sense of the majority of what you are reading, leaving your scribes to do the majority of the interpretation for you. Still, you persist through the struggles one faces while interpreting an entire library of ancient texts, and as you question yourself internally, you are left with two choices: Reject these newfound teachings or try to incorporate them into your beliefs."
 etd_kabbalah_events.1.a:0 "One would be foolish to believe this has no value. I ponder its origins."
 etd_kabbalah_events.1.b:0 "This is completely incomprehensible & borderline heresy."

 etd_kabbalah_events.2.desc:0 "As my scribes & I spend hours in isolation from the rest of the world, we discover more about the significance of each Sephira. Each is an attribute or emanation of the creator's infinite light. It seems as though the concepts brought forth from this school of thought can be applied to subjects other than theology."
 etd_kabbalah_events.2.a:0 "These discoveries will benefit my people for years to come!"
